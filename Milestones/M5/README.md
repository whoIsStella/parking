## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Milestone 5 consists of the following deliverables:

1. **Complete Documentation:** Submit a comprehensive `M5.pdf` (details below).
2. **Final Project Delivery:** Ensure all code and documentation are in GitHub.

### Important Reminder

After submitting M5, back up your code as we may shut down GitHub servers to make room for the next semester.
The organization of your code and documentation will form part of your professional portfolio, so ensure everything is well-prepared.

## Checkpoint #1: Final Documentation (4 points)

This checkpoint serves as the final version of your project's technical documentation.

### <a id="head1"></a> Technical Documentation

Your `M5.pdf` should include the following sections:

 1. **Cover Page:**

- Title: ‚ÄúThe name of your project‚Äù
- Team number, application name, team members (lead first with email)
- URLs: URL pointing to the home page of your project (this url must match the one in your repository)
- Date: Thursday, 12/12/2024 at 9:00 am
- History table (revisions) (This will be updated based on instructor feedback, so it is important).
  - The history table should follow the following format:

     | Milestone   | Version    | Date                                                  |
     |-------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
     | Milestone 5 | No Version | date the milestone was submitted                      |
     | Milestone 4 | Version 2  | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
     | Milestone 4 | Version 1  | date the milestone was submitted                      |
     | Milestone 3 | Version 2  | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
     | Milestone 3 | Version 1  | date the milestone was submitted                      |
     | Milestone 2 | Version 2  | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
     | Milestone 2 | Version 1  | date the milestone was submitted                      |
     | Milestone 1 | Version 2  | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
     | Milestone 1 | Version 1  | date the milestone was submitted                      |

     **Important:** Milestone 5 is a final, stand-alone document with no versioning.

### 2. **Table of Contents**

- The Table of Contents should serve as a navigational guide for your document.
- Each entry in the Table of Contents must be a link that directs to the corresponding section within the document.
- Additionally, ensure that each entry includes the correct page number where the section can be found.
     This will allow readers to quickly locate and access the information they need.
     The format should be clear and organized, providing a seamless experience for anyone reviewing the document.

2. **Product Summary:** (Copy from M4V2 for completeness)
   - Product name, major functions and services provided by the software product, and unique features

3. **Milestone Documents:**
   - Include `M1v2.pdf`, `M2v2.pdf`, `M3v2.pdf`, and `M4v2.pdf` (do not include V1s). Merge these PDFs into `M5.pdf`,
     which will serve as the technical documentation for your project.
   - Note: There is no need to reorganize the table of contents from each milestone to match the order of content in M5. Leave it as it is.

4. **Team Member Contributions:**
   - **Team Lead:**
     - Provide a high-level summary of each member‚Äôs contributions **throughout the semester.**
     - Assign a score (1‚Äì10) for each member's overall contributions. The instructor will verify these scores.
   - **All Team Members:**
     - If you have any final comments to evaluate your team lead or any other member of the team, please email the instructor.

5. **Post-Analysis ‚Äì Lessons Learned:** (One page)
   The post-analysis is a report written by the team lead that summarizes the main challenges encountered, both in the
   project and within the team. This report suggests improvements for future projects. In industry, this type of report is common
   after the completion of a project and can influence promotions for members of the team. It also serves as a guide for other
   team leads working on similar projects.

   - **Team Lead‚Äôs Role:** Consult with team members before writing this section.
   - Provide a summary of the main challenges and propose improvements for the future.
   - Note: This type of final report is also standard practice in the industry.

#### General Guidelines

- **AI Work Prohibition:**
  - If we find evidence of work done by AI in the `M5.pdf` document, the entire team will receive **zero points**
    It is crucial that the Team Lead or Technical Writer thoroughly review all work done in the document to ensure it is consensual and authentic.

- **Missing Sections Penalty:**
  - If any section of this checkpoint is missing or incomplete, then the team will receive **zero points** for this milestone. **No exceptions!!!**
  - Recall that this is the last milestone of the semester.

# üéâ You Did It! üéâ

Hey Team!

Congratulations, you‚Äôve survived the rollercoaster ride that is Software Engineering! From debugging mysteries to those
*"aha!"* moments at 3 AM, you've powered through it all. Whether your code was elegant or a bit of a spaghetti monster,
you made it to the finish line‚Äîand that‚Äôs what counts!

Now that you've completed the course, you're ready to answer a question I asked at the beginning of the semester:
Do you want to be a Software Engineer or a Software Developer?

## <a id="head6"></a> Key Takeaways

- **Collaboration Matters:** The ability to work effectively as part of a team is crucial in software engineering.
The experiences you've had in coordinating with your peers, managing version control, and merging code are all vital skills that will serve you well in your future career.
  
- **Attention to Detail:** As you've likely learned, overlooking small details can lead to significant issues later on.
Maintaining rigorous attention to detail‚Äîwhether in writing code, creating documentation, or managing a project‚Äîis essential for success.

- **Continuous Learning:** The field of software engineering is ever-evolving. The tools, languages, and
methodologies you‚Äôve learned this semester are just the beginning. Stay curious, continue learning, and keep refining your skills.

## Looking Forward

As you move forward, remember that this course is just a foundation. The skills and knowledge you‚Äôve acquired here will be built upon with every new project, job, and learning opportunity.

- **Portfolio Development:** Make sure your final project and documentation are well-organized and polished.
This is a valuable addition to your professional portfolio, which you can showcase in job interviews or internship applications.
Many students from this class have landed jobs at reputable companies by highlighting the work they did in this course.

- **Networking:** Keep in touch with your peers and instructors. Networking is a key component of a successful career in software engineering,
 and the connections you make now can open doors in the future.

## <a id="head7"></a> Final Words

Thank you for your hard work, dedication, and effort throughout this semester. Software engineering is a challenging but
rewarding field, and you‚Äôve all made significant progress. Whether you continue in this discipline or take your skills into a new area, I wish you the best of luck.

Remember: every great software engineer was once a beginner, just like you. Keep pushing boundaries, keep solving problems, and never stop coding!

As you close this chapter, take a moment to give yourself a pat on the back. You didn‚Äôt just write code; you built something from scratch, wrangled it into submission, and learned a ton along the way.

- **Pro Tip:** Keep those debugging skills sharp‚Äîthey‚Äôll come in handy more often than you think.
- **Next Steps:** Take some time to relax, recharge, and then get ready to dive back into the world of code (or take a well-deserved break from it).

## Keep in Touch

Just because the semester‚Äôs over doesn‚Äôt mean the fun has to stop. Stay connected with your classmates and your instructor.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, even the best coders started with a ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù So keep coding, keep learning, and most importantly, keep having fun with it.
The world is your oyster (or your IDE, whichever you prefer). üéÆüíª

Thanks for being an awesome class‚Äînow go out there and engineer the future!

Best wishes for your future endeavors!

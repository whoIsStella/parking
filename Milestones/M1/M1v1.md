## Executive Summary

Parking in cities is a daily headache for millions, wasting time, fuel, and patience as drivers circle blocks searching for spots. Meanwhile, countless private parking spaces sit empty and unused. Parking Space Marketplace bridges this gap by creating a vibrant, community driven platform where anyone can list or discover parking spaces for short term use.

With Parking Space Marketplace, drivers can easily find available parking in their area, while property owners earn extra income by sharing their unused spots. Our platform offers reliable search, transparent pricing, and a user friendly experience that builds trust between drivers and space owners. By enabling better use of existing spaces, Parking Space Marketplace makes parking smarter, more affordable, and more convenient for everyone.

## Main Use Cases

### Use Case 1: List a Parking Space
Owner uploads info, sets price, and posts availability. If the info is incomplete, app prompts for missing data.

**Actors:** Macy (apartment resident), Parking Space Marketspace (company)

**Assumptions:**
- Macy has a phone and access to the internet.
- Macy has parking space she does not use often.
- Macy has a parking space that intrests renters. 

**Use Case:**
Macy has been living in the city for a while now. As such, she has found her way to move around without the need for a car. Recently, Macy decided to get rid of some junk she had in her parking garage but is unsure of what to fill the space with. She does not want to leave it empty, as she believes that would be a waste of space. She surfs the web, looking for ideas or inspiration as to what to fill the garage with. During this search, Macy comes across the Parking Space Marketspace. Out of curiosity, she looks around the site and quickly finds out that she can sell her garage to people. She considers how many places of interest are near her home, specifically a park that is usually filled with lots of people, and so she decides to register her spot into the website. Not only has Macy figured out what to do with the garage, but she can earn some money on the side as well. The application makes it easy for her to list her parking space and change the price and when it is available for renters. 

**Benefits:**
- Macy can set her price for the parking spot, allowing her to earn more money.
- Macy can decide when her garage is available, which allows her to plan ahead.
- Macy can if needed update her listing, making sure her parking space will be looked at for customers wanting to rent.

### Use Case 2: List a Parking Space
Renter enters location, desired time; app shows nearby available spots on a map. If no spaces found, app suggests adjusting filters or dates.

**Actors:** Bob (student), Josh (Bob’s friend), Parking Space Marketspace (company)

**Assumptions:**
- Bob has access to a phone and owns a car.
- Bob is aware of when and where he wants the desired parking place.
- Bob is able to pay for this service. 

**Use Case:**
Bob has made his class schedule for next semester. He has classes every Tuesday and Thursday starting with Biology at 11:00 am. While Bob is excited to take Biology, he is also worried that there will not be any parking spaces left at that time. Bob asks his friend John for help. John suggests arriving at an earlier time to claim a parking spot, but Bob rejects the idea. He cannot arrive at the campus at an earlier time. Josh then suggests that Bob could take the class at another time to make sure he does not arrive late, but Bob explains that all other class times are full. Josh thinks for a moment before recommending Parking Space Marketplace. Bob decides to take a look at the website, despite never hearing about it. After filling in the location of his university, the site shows him some nearby spaces available. He notices one that is pretty close to his Biology class and checks to see when he can claim the space. Luckily, he can reserve the spot up until his last class and for the entire semester. Bob can now look forward to taking Biology, especially with a guarantee that he will not be late due to parking.

**Benefits:**
- Bob can reserve a spot in advance and for how long, allowing him to plan ahead.
- Bob can choose a location to find nearby spots, giving him more freedom.
- Bob will save time as well as minimize the stress that comes with finding a parking space. 
- Bob can find a parking space in his price range.

### Use Case 3:
Renter selects a spot, reviews details, and confirms booking. If payment fails, app prompts renter to retry or choose a different method.

**Actors:** Richard (Customer/User), Parking Space MarketSpace (Company)

**Assumptions:**

- Richard is a busy lawyer who frequently travels to the city for work.
- Richard already uses the Parking Space MarketSpace app.
- Richard relies on his default card payment for his payment method.

**Use Case:**

Richard is a busy lawyer who travels frequently to the city for work. He already uses the Parking Space Marketspace app to find parking spots in the city, as it is hard for him to find a parking spot that is next to his office building. To give Richard peace of mind when booking the parking space, he has already saved his card as a default card payment every time he books a parking space. Usually, it gives him a confirmation that the spot has been successfully booked. Unfortunately, Richard didn’t realize that the default card payment he has booked has already been expired. When Richard booked the usual parking spot that he usually goes for, the app gave him a notification that his card has already been expired so it cannot process the transaction. It prompted Richard to put a new card on file or to try it again. To make it easier for Richard, the app gave him an option to capture the image of his card, and it would fill up his information or he could write his information down manually. After choosing the first option, the app later on asked if he would like this new card to be his default card payment on file in which Richard opted in for. After fixing the payment issue, Richard proceeded to book his usual parking spot successfully giving him confirmation regarding the reservation as well as the information for the parking space to answer any questions the customer could have. 

**Benefits:**

- Richard has security that his payment went through, and his booking was successful with a confirmation
- Efficiency and convenience with booking because of the saved card payment information.
- Richard has security and peace of mind regarding why the issue arises with his payment method.

### Use Case 4: Cancel a Booking

- **Description:**

  Renter or owner cancels before start time; system notifies the other party. If cancellation is too close to start, app enforces cancellation policy.

- **Actors:**

  Leo (spot/owner), Derek (customer/renter), Parking Space Marketspace

- **Assumptions:**

  - Either party can choose to cancel before the reservation start time
  - The cancellation policies are in place and have been agreed upon.

- **Use Case:**

  Leo just realizes that he will not be able to use his driveway for the upcoming reservation as it will be inaccessible due to construction going on. He needs to cancel the reservation before the time that it starts, so he logs into the app and finds his active booking to cancel it. Derek the spot renter is immediately notified and receives a full refund since he was not the one to cancel and the cancellation happened 24 hours in advance. The app then provides Derek with suggested alternative parking spaces around the same area.

- **Benefits:**

  - Provides flexibility for both parties/users
  - Handles refunds and re-bookings to make it simple and easy
  - Nofications will be sent to both of the parties for communication.

### Use Case 5:
Renter and owner communicate about arrival or specific instructions. If inappropriate messages are detected, admin is alerted.

**Actors:**  Koa (Renter), Milo (Owner), Parking Space MarketSpace (Company/admin)

**Assumptions:**

- Koa rented Milo’s parking space from 1:30 - 2:30 PM on the Parking Space MarketSpace (Company)
- Milo has been using Parking Space MarketSpace to rent out his parking space and his parking space is in a popular area, as it is in the city and close to businesses that people usually go to
- Users have the option to message each other. 
- The app has language moderation to make sure users have a postive expierence. 

**Use Case:**

Koa is visiting the city to run some errands and found that Milo’s spot is close to the places that he needs to go to. Koa saw that the only time that his space is available is from 1:30 - 2:30 PM. Koa booked for that time slot but decided to come early to hopefully finish his errands earlier without telling Milo. Koa also received specific instructions to arrive on the time slot booked. Koa came at around 12:00 PM to the parking spot only to find out that it has been taken by another car. Koa contacted Milo saying he is here for the 1:30 - 2:30 parking spot appointment. Milo told Koa that the parking spot has already been booked by someone from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM. Koa insisted that Milo can accommodate his situation since he came a long way from home to get into the city. Milo insisted that he cannot kick out guest who are already in the spot and who have booked it for that time slot. This made Koa mad since Milo could not accommodate to his requests and started cussing Milo out in the chat. Koa even made death threats towards Milo and said he is going to sue Milo for wasting his time. The admin got alerted to the inappropriate message that Koa was saying in the chat and gave a warning on Koa’s side that inappropriate messages are not allowed and could lead to his account being banned or suspended. On Milo’s side it gave him an option to block Koa and cancel his reservation. Milo not wanting to deal with Koa, he opted to block Koa and cancel his reservation. After Milo selected this option, Koa isn’t allowed to message Milo anymore as well as a notification saying his reservation has been canceled. There will be evidence about this interaction. 

**Benefits:**

- Koa received specific instructions regarding the reservation, including the time slot of when his reservation starts. Koa has the privilege to message Milo regarding the reservation and vice versa, allowing issues to be addressed directly with the owner.
- Koa is given the chance to correct his behavior, letting him realize that his behavior is inappropriate towards Milo because of the warning given to him and the consequences given to him.
- Milo has the protection to not tolerate the inappropriate behavior that Koa has displayed by giving him an option to block and cancel Koa’s reservation.

This situation poses a significant safety concern for Cynthia, especially considering the prevalent news reports of violence against women in her area. To address this issue, Cynthia explored the possibility of securing a parking space closer to her home. She discovered that one of her neighbors had an unused parking spot that she could rent.

While our idea is not new to the market, our service will have multiple advantages over the competition. Aside from providing the features
mentioned in the high level comparison, our major competitive edge is giving the user complete freedom. The four companies mentioned above 
all enact limitations on how their users can park. Park Mobile allows their users to chose how long they wish to park, however, they can 
only park for at most a day. YourParkingSpace gives their users more freedom than Park Mobile, but it still limits them for at most three 
days parking. Then there are SpotHero and Spacer, which have the opposite problem, as they only allow monthly parking. As for AirGarage,
their service depends on their partners, which are usually parking lots or parking garages, so they are probably limited to daily parking.
While these services are nice, they fail to solve all problems involving parking. what if there is a student who has class from 12:00 to 3:00
Every Tuesday and Thursday? There is no easy way for them to guarantee a parking spot for an entire semester. That is, without our service.
In other words, our service will handle the more specific scenarios that remain unresolved, or require a difficult solution, by giving more
flexibility to the user. No daily limit, no monthly limit, just complete freedom to register at specific times for some duration, on top of
what the comptetion already provides.

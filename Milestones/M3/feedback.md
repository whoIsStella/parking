# M3v1 Feedback and Prototype Grading

As many of you already know, I am a very direct and honest person, my goal is to help you grow, even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations. With that in mind, there are a few important points I need to address regarding your team's recent performance:

- I suspect that the missing contributions section was not an oversight. Rather, I believe Stella chose not to include it because the scores may have reflected ongoing issues that I've already observed, such as some members are not contributing at the expected level.
- It seems this team may be taking the class—and each other—for granted. There has been a noticeable decline in collaboration, with certain members shouldering the majority of the work while others disengage.
- I want to be crystal clear: free riding or contributing below expectations will not be rewarded in this class. This course carries significant weight in your degree program, and performance is evaluated both individually and as a team. Anyone who is not doing their fair share will receive an unsatisfactory grade at the end of the semester.
- I’m especially concerned because the team lead is carrying most of the workload alone. This is not sustainable, nor is it acceptable.
- Some members have cited being on “vacation” or otherwise unavailable; however, please remember that I monitor and take notes on all contributions made throughout the semester. These are factored into your final grade, whether visible to you now or not.
- Finally, all the teams are attending office hours to address the issues they are facing and looking for help. Most of these issues are solved during office hours with my advice. However, this team seems to be disconnected from the reality of this class, and ultimately, none of you have attended office hours to address the issues (which are many) you are facing
  Academically, and in life in general, issues do not resolve by themselves. You need to address them, and ask for help. I am here to help and my goal is to help you succedd in this class, but I am not a mind reader and you guys are the ones need to take the first step to reach for help

Because of the current lack of cohesion and teamwork, I am unable to award your group the highest milestone rating this time. That said, there will be another opportunity during the next milestone. I strongly encourage all of you to regroup and take collective responsibility moving forward.

Going forward, as you may already know, your team lead will focus solely on her core responsibilities: managing the team, setting internal deadlines and dependencies, and reviewing work. It’s important that the rest of the team understands what this shift means and steps up to contribute more actively. Collaboration is not optional in this class, it’s essential.

**Prototype Grade:** 7/7  

**GitHub Organization:** –2 points  
(To be deducted from the final milestone grade after reviewing your M3v2 documentation at the end of the semester.)

**Missing Sections:** 20% deducted from your final grade in this milestone  
(To be deducted from this milestone's final grade for all team members.)

Stay sharp for the next milestone, you’ve got this!

## Checkpoint 1

### Data Definitions

- What happened to your data definitions? They’ve been replaced with only attributes. While it’s fine to begin introducing attributes at this stage, you need to maintain consistency with previous milestones. Removing definitions without explanation is not acceptable.

### Team Contributions

- This section is missing. As stated in the class policies and syllabus, this results in a 20% deduction from your milestone grade.

## Checkpoint 2

- Strong work here—but as mentioned above, it appears this was completed by one person rather than the team. Collaboration is key.

## Checkpoint 3

### Credentials Folder

- As discussed in class and lectures, this folder is critical for the CTO review.
- Several required components are missing:

  - **Application Folder:**
    - Missing everything outlined in the README: Overview, Features, Installation, etc. (This was the responsibility of the technical writer.)

  - **Credentials Folder:**
    - Missing **Security Guidelines** and **Contact Information**—both are essential for the CTO review.

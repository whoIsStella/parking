## Product Summary

### Product Name

ParkSpace

### Final Priority 1 and 2 Requirements

#### Renter

**Searching and Viewing Parking Spaces**

Renters have a lot of freedom in searching a space. They can sort by date, time, price, etc, or they can use the interactive map to find the perfect parking spot. Moreover, renters can learn more about a specific parking spot, such as photos, the owner's rules, and any unique features regarding the spot.

**Booking and Payment**

Just like searching a space, ParkSpace gives the renter a lot of fredom in booking a space. Renters can decide when and for how long they want to rent out a parking space. They have multiple ways to pay for the sapce, and they have the right to cancel and refund, as long as they follow the refund policy that is. Speaking of payment methods, renters can enjoy paying for their spaces through saved payment methods. This, of course, means that they can update or delete payment methods from their account.

**Managing Bookings and Reviews**

When it comes to services provided by people to people, there is always a risk involved. However, renters can report any issues that arise with us, and can infrom their fellow renters by leaving a review. In addition, renters will be able to look at previous bookings and upcomming ones, along with being able to extend their booking, with the owner's permission, or course.

**Profile and Communication**

To best ensure safety and security, ParkSpace lets renters make an account. They can personalize it adding photos and a few words about themselves. More importantly, renters' accounts will serve as their way to communicate with the owner about the rented space, along with reminders about bockings and payment alerts, all of which can be altered to their preference.

#### Owner

**Listing and Managing Parking Spaces**

ParkSpace makes sure renters have as much freedom as possible for renting a space, and the same mentality is applied to owners. Owners can decide their own prices, their availablity, add rules regarding the space, and provide bonuses like photos and amenities to better sell their spot. And if they ever change their mind, they can update existing spaces, or delete it entirely.

**Managing Bookings and Earnings**

With an account, owners are able to see and manage all their parking spaces, their earnings, and recieve notifications regarding their space. In addition, owners can update their banking information and can accept or decline incoming book requests. And just like renters, owners are free to change their account information whenever they wish.

#### Admin

**User and Content Management**

While we at ParkSpace hope that all transactions run smoothly, we understand that problems can, and will, arise, which is why we have administrators at the ready. These adinistrators will monitor all user accounts, making sure that all transactions end well. And if a transactions goes wrong, our administrators can remove any inappropriate content or reviews, or, if worst comes to pass, suspend or ban accounts.

**Payments and Analytics**

Administrators also have a responsiblity to handle the money side of ParkSpace. Specifically, they will manage all transactions, issuing refunds or platform fees if needed. They will also monitor the perfomances of the site, along with all the financial reports and usage metrics.

**Platform Settings and Policies**

Administrators are also in charge of the more legal topics of ParkSpace, such as updating our privacy policy, terms and conditions, and will send notifications to all users when needed.

#### 4. All Users

**General Features**

As mentioned before, all users will need an account to experience all that ParkSpace can offer. This means that their accounts will be protected, and that any user can reset their password, delete their account, manage their notifications, view the websites policies, and if any confusion arises, seek help at our help center.

### Unique Features

To stand out from our competitors, ParkSpace has a variety of features that are do not exist, or are very limited, in other services. ParkSpace offers
direct messaging between the renter and the owner so that they have the option to discuss in more deatail about the arrangement. And of course, ParkSpace also has the necessary tools to ensure that these messages do not turn violent or problematic, such as have a report feature. ParkSpace also offers flexible scheduling for owners, and by extension, renters. Owners can set their availability to any time, any day of the week. Moreover, they have the opportunity to change their schedule, assuming it does not interfere with existing arrangements. This also means that renters are free to claim a sport for as long as they wish, assuming the space is available. And if any vehicle related problems occur, such as a flat tire, ParkSpace lets renters request assitance and call some service providers like Allstate. Finally, ParkSpace offers a discount to college students, as they are the group that stand to gain the most out of this service.

## Usability Test Plan

### Test Functions

The following five major functions were selected from our superior features for usability testing:

1. **Listing a Space**
2. **Booking a Space**
3. **Submitting a Support Ticket**
4. **Requesting Roadside Assistance**
5. **Leaving a Message**

---

### Test Objectives

The objective of this usability test is to evaluate the intuitiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction of the core flows that differentiate ParkSpace from competitors. We aim to identify any pain points, confusing steps, or barriers to completion in the most important user journeys. By observing users not involved in development as they attempt these tasks, we can measure both the effectiveness and efficiency of our design, as well as gather direct feedback on user satisfaction. This process will help us ensure that our unique features are not only functional but also easy and pleasant to use for our target audience.

## Localization Testing

### Localization Plan

If this application were to globalize, the biggest part that would need to be changed, other than the language, is the map. We would need to find popular cities in other countries so that our application would be useful to the most people. This also means that the application would need to know where the user is on the planet so that the map will automatically appear at the closest supported city. Some relatively smaller things that wil need to change are the way time is portrayed in the front end, which uses am and pm, the available amenities, as some may be nonexistent in some parts of the world, possibily all of roadside service, which may be completely different in other countries, and ensuring the proper postal code is used in the right countries. As for the language, since most information on the site is presented through text, we would need to focus on ensuring that the message stays consistent throughout each country. Also, the main color of the site may need to be tweaked depending on the country as the color purple may have different meanings depending on the culture.

### Test Cases

#### Australian English (en-AU)

| Test # | Feature | Input | Expected Output | Pass/Fail |
| :----: | :------ | :---- | :-------------- | :-------: |
|   1    | Spelling | Set user locale to `en-AU` and navigate to the "List a Space" page. | Text should use Australian/British spelling, e.g., "colour," "centre," "licence." | Pass |
|   2    | Date Format | View a booking confirmation page. | Date should be displayed in `DD/MM/YYYY` format (e.g., 31/07/2025). | Pass |
|   3    | Currency | View the price of a parking space. | Price should be clearly marked with "AUD" or "$AU" (e.g., AUD $25.00). | Fail |
|   4    | Terminology | View the main search page and space details. | Common terms should match local usage. For example, "parking lot" should be presented as "car park." | Fail |
|   5    | Tone & Connotation | Read button text and success messages (e.g., "Book Now," "You're all set!"). | The friendly and slightly informal tone should feel natural and not like an awkward Americanism. | Pass |

#### Welsh English (en-GB / cy-GB)

| Test # | Feature | Input | Expected Output | Pass/Fail |
| :----: | :------ | :---- | :-------------- | :-------: |
|   1    | Spelling | Set user locale to `en-GB` and navigate to the "Support Ticket" page. | Text should use British spelling, e.g., "organise," "centre." | Pass |
|   2    | Date Format | View booking history. | Date should be displayed in `DD/MM/YYYY` format. | Pass |
|   3    | Currency | View the price of a parking space. | Price should be displayed with the Pound Sterling symbol (£), e.g., £20.00. | Fail |
|   4    | Contextual Terms | View the booking form where vehicle details are required. | The term "license plate" should be replaced with the more common British term "number plate" or "registration." | Fail |
|   5    | Instructional Clarity | Read the instructions for leaving a review. | The instructions should be clear and use phrasing common in British English, avoiding any US-specific idioms. | Pass |

### Results

The localization testing revealed that while our foundational localization is on the right track, we lack the deep contextual adaptation required for a truly global product.

**Successes:**

- Basic spelling and date formats were correctly adapted for both locales.
- The general tone of the application was found to be appropriate and did not cause any negative cultural connotations in either test case.

**Failures:**

- **Currency:** This remains a critical failure. The system did not adapt the currency symbol or code (e.g., to AUD or £), which would cause significant confusion for users.
- **Terminology:** The application failed to switch from American English terms to their regional equivalents (e.g., "parking lot" vs. "car park," "license plate" vs. "number plate"). This indicates that our translation process is too literal and does not account for regional vocabulary differences.

These results show that we need to move beyond simple string replacement and implement a more sophisticated localization strategy that includes a glossary of regional terms and proper internationalization (i18n) support for data formats like currency.

## Code Review

### Coding Standards

Our team adheres to a strict set of coding standards to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability across the project. These standards are enforced through a combination of automated tooling and manual peer review.

**General Standards:**

- **Indentation:** All source files use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Encoding:** All source files are encoded in UTF-8.
- **File Naming:** File names are in `kebab-case` for frontend components and `snake_case` for Python modules, where applicable.
- **Commit Messages:** All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

**Backend (Python/Django):**

- **Style Guide:** We follow the **PEP 8** style guide for all Python code.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Code is automatically linted with `flake8` and formatted with `black` to ensure consistency.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Modules: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions & Variables: `snake_case`
- **Docstrings:** All public modules, classes, and functions include docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

**Frontend (TypeScript/React):**

- **Style Guide:** We follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Code is automatically linted with `ESLint` and formatted with `Prettier`.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ChatBox.tsx`)
  - Hooks: `camelCase` with a `use` prefix (e.g., `useAPI.tsx`)
  - Variables & Functions: `camelCase`
- **Component Structure:** Components are kept small and focused on a single responsibility. State management is handled by React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, `useReducer`) and custom hooks for reusable logic.

### Internal Review

Our internal review process is centered around GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) to ensure that every line of code is reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the `main` branch. This process is crucial for catching bugs, improving code quality, and sharing knowledge across the team.

**Our Process:**

1. A developer creates a new feature branch from the `main` branch.
2. After completing the feature and testing it locally, the developer opens a Pull Request.
3. The PR title and description clearly explain the changes and their purpose.
4. At least one other developer is assigned as a reviewer.
5. The reviewer examines the code for correctness, adherence to coding standards, and potential improvements.
6. Feedback is provided through comments and suggestions directly on the PR.
7. The original developer addresses the feedback and pushes updates to the branch.
8. Once all comments are resolved and the reviewer approves the changes, the PR is merged into `main`.

**Example of Internal Review:**

- **Pull Request Example:**

## Security Practices

### Major Assets

    - Renter's card information (if they choose to use their debit or credit card)
    - Owner's bank account information
    - All user's passwords

### Password Encryption

The application uses Django's robust, built in security framework for password management. All user passwords are required to be hashed and salted before being stored in the database, ensuring they are never saved in plaintext. The primary hashing algorithm configured for the project is **Argon2**, as specified in the `PASSWORD_HASHERS` setting. Argon2 is a modern, key-stretching algorithm that is highly resistant to both brute force and rainbow table attacks, providing a very high level of security for user credentials.

### Input Validation

Input validation is strictly enforced at the backend to prevent common web vulnerabilities. The application utilizes Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers, which automatically validate incoming data against the defined model fields (e.g., checking data types, max lengths, and field constraints). This serves as the first line of defense against malformed data.

Furthermore, custom validation logic is implemented within the serializers and API views to enforce business rules, such as ensuring prices are positive numbers, validating email formats, and checking that all required fields for an operation are present. This multi-layered validation strategy effectively mitigates risks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other data driven attacks by Making sure all data is sanitized and conforms to expected formats before being processed.

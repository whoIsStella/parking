The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the tasks required for each checkpoint. All team members are
expected to read the entire document. The Team Lead is responsible for coordinating and leading the team's efforts
throughout all checkpoints in this milestone.

##  Checkpoint #1: Technical Documentation (4 points)

**Objective:**

  - To make a final commitment for functions to be delivered (e.g., list of Priority 1 and Priority 2 functions) and which will be used in grading
  - To check that all required non-functional specs are satisfied or on track
  - To practice formal usability testing plan development
  - To practice formal QA testing
  - To practice code review


**Initial Input:** The technical documentation from this milestone must have to be reasonably consistent with the
one created in Milestone 3 (version 2) and instructors or grader feedback, but it can also differ
from Milestone 3 based on what you discover and develop in your design process in the spirit of iterative SE process and based on the feedback you get.

### <a id="head1"></a> Collaborative Approach

To effectively create and complete the M4 document, I recommend the following collaborative approach:

1. **Assignment of Roles:**
   - The Team Lead assigns a **Technical Writer** to oversee the creation and edition of the document.

2. **Division of Work:**
   - The Technical Writer assigns individual chapters to each team member.
   - It is strongly recommended that all team members collaborate on testing the most important unique features of your project.
     This approach ensures high-quality, synchronized work.

3. **Document Integration:**
   - The Technical Writer collects the chapters, edits, and corrects them, and integrates them into a well-formatted
     document with consistent fonts and formatting. Repeat this step as needed.
   - Recommended tools to create-edit your document include [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
     (note that Notion's free tier is limited). Google Docs can also be used.

4. **Team Review:**
   - The Technical Writer, with the supervision of the Team Lead, posts the final draft document on the team repository.
     All team members should read the full document for one last review and provide any feedback.

5. **Finalization:**
   - The **Technical Writer** finalizes the document based on the team's feedback.
   - The Team Lead is responsible for approving the document for final submission. If the document is returned by
     the CTO (instructor), it will be considered the Team Lead's responsibility, as ensuring the submission of high-quality
     work is one of the key duties of the Team Lead.


### <a id="head2"></a> Technical Documentation

In the document for Milestone 3 version 1 (`M4v1.pdf`), you must include **all** the following sections in the exact order listed below. Each section of this document should start on a new page within the same PDF file:

#### 1) Title Page: MUST include:

   - “SW Engineering CSC648-848-05 Fall 2024”
   - Project/application title and name (use the name chosen for your application)
   - Team number
   - Names of students (Team Lead first) with the Team Lead's email. Mark the roles of Team Lead, Front End Lead, Back End Lead, and GitHub Master.
   - “Milestone 4”
   - Date
   - History table (revisions) (This will be updated based on instructor feedback, so it is important).
     - The history table should follow the following format:

       | Milestone   | Version   | Date                                                  |
       |-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
       | Milestone 4 | Version 1 | date the milestone was submitted                      |
       | Milestone 3 | Version 2 | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
       | Milestone 3 | Version 1 | date the milestone was submitted                      |
       | Milestone 2 | Version 2 | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
       | Milestone 2 | Version 1 | date the milestone was submitted                      |
       | Milestone 1 | Version 2 | date of the most recent modification of this version  |
       | Milestone 1 | Version 1 | date the milestone was submitted                      |

     - Once Version 2 of this milestone is created, the history table in your `M4v2.pdf` file should be updated with a new row that includes Version 2 and the date it was last modified.
     - This history table should be sorted in descending order, with the newest version at the top.

#### 2) Table of Contents

   - The Table of Contents should serve as a navigational guide for your document.
   - Each entry in the Table of Contents must be a link that directs to the corresponding section within the document.
   - Additionally, ensure that each entry includes the correct page number where the section can be found.
     This will allow readers to quickly locate and access the information they need.
     The format should be clear and organized, providing a seamless experience for anyone reviewing the document.

#### 3) Product Summary

- **Product Name**
- **Final P1 and P2 Functional Requirements:** Provide an itemized list of all major committed functions
(FINAL P1 and P2 functions or services) that will be delivered and tested. This is your final functional commitment—failure to deliver these will affect your grade.
- **Unique Features:** Describe what makes your product unique or superior, comparing it with a competitor's product.
  Note that you will have to test functions of your unique features in this milestone.
- **Deployment URL:** Include the URL where your product can be accessed. The same url that is in your main README file

#### 4) Usability Test Plan

- **Test Functions:** Select FIVE major functions (excluding login or registration) from your superior features for usability testing.
- **Test Components:**
  - **Test Objectives:** Briefly describe what is being tested and why (0.5 page).
  - **Test Description:** Outline the system setup, starting point, intended users, and the URL of the system being tested (up to 1 page).
  - **Effectiveness Table:** Measure the effectiveness of the functions tested.
  - **Efficiency Table:** Measure the efficiency of the functions tested.
  - **User Satisfaction:** Use a Likert questionnaire with 3 statements per function tested (total 15 statements)

**Note:** Ensure that tests are performed by people not familiar with the project or who are part of your target audience.

#### 5) QA Test Plan

- **Test Plan:** Select FIVE non-functional requirements (each from a different category) and write a QA test plan for each, including:
  - Test Objectives
  - HW and SW Setup (including URL)
  - Feature to be Tested
  - QA Test Plan: Provide 3 test cases and results (per non-functional requirement), using a tabular format with columns
    for test #, title, task description, input, expected output, and results (PASS/FAIL).

- **Testing Execution:** Perform the tests across all supported browser versions and record the results.

#### 8) Localization Testing

- **Localization Plan:** Describe your plan for testing the application in different languages or regions.
- **Test Cases:** Provide test cases for verifying that all elements (text, UI, etc.) are properly localized.
- **Results:** Record and analyze the results of localization tests, noting any issues found.

#### 6) Code Review

- **Coding Standards:** Detail the team's coding best practices.
- **GitHub Code Review:** Include screenshots of your internal (done within the team) code review process, showing pull requests and comments.
- **External Code Review:** Perform a code review for another team, via email, and attach screenshots of the collaboration.

#### 7) Self-Check on Security Practices

- **Major Assets:** List the major assets you are protecting.
- **Password Encryption:** Confirm and describe the process of encrypting passwords in the database, with screenshots.
- **Input Validation:** List validated inputs and provide examples of validation code, including search bar input.

#### 8) Self-Check: Adherence to Non-Functional Specs

- **Status Update:** Copy all original non-functional specs from M1V2 and mark each as DONE, ON TRACK, or ISSUE, with explanations if there are problems.


##### 9) List of Team Contributions:

- **Part #1 (Must be completed by team lead Only):**
  - Provide a detailed list of contributions made by each team member for both Checkpoint #1 and Checkpoint #2 of this milestone
  - Assign a contribution score to each member, using a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = no contribution, 10 = maximum contribution).
    The instructor also tracks each member's contributions. Misrepresenting contributions will not be tolerated.
    The Team Lead must be honest in evaluating team members. If a discrepancy arises between the Team Lead’s score
    and the instructor’s observations (e.g., an 8 versus a 2), it will be assumed that the team is covering up for
    a lack of effort, negatively impacting the overall team grade. While being a Team Lead is rewarding for learning
    and leadership development, it carries significant responsibility, as the team’s grade depends on the Lead's actions.
- **Part #2 (Must be completed by all team members):**
  - Every team member, including the Team Lead, must email the CTO ([jortizco@sfsu.edu](mailto:jortizco@sfsu.edu)) with any feedback or
    complaints about other team members or the team as a whole.
  - You can follow the following template for guidance: [Feedback-Complaints Email](#head4).
      - **Note:** This template is provided as a reference only. Please personalize your feedback based on your
        unique experiences with your team. Do not copy and paste the content directly; instead, use it as a starting
        point to craft your own detailed and honest feedback.
  - **Complaints will remain anonymous, known only to the instructor.** If necessary, the instructor may address
    issues with the Team Lead, but the identities of those who provided feedback will not be disclosed.
    This process is similar to performance evaluations in software companies, where HR or managers use feedback
    to make decisions about promotions and team dynamics.


### <a id="head4"></a> Submission Guidelines (Checkpoint #1)

1. ***Submission Required from All Team Members***

     To: jortizco@sfsu.edu  
     Subject: CSC648.848.05 Team 09 Milestone 4 Feedback-Complaints

     Hi Professor,

     The following is my feedback-complaints for all my team members and my team as a whole:

     1. Individual Feedback:

         - Nina Pickles (Team Lead): Nina has been excellent at organizing meetings and keeping everyone on track, but 
           sometimes the instructions could be clearer to avoid misunderstandings. 

         - Ivana Drago: Ivana's coding skills are top-notch, and she consistently delivers on time, but she sometimes 
           hesitates to ask for help when stuck, which could improve team collaboration.

         - Lulu Joy: Lulu brings great ideas to the table and is always ready to contribute, but her documentation 
           could be more detailed to help others understand her work better.

         - Ozzie Bear: Ozzie is proactive and often takes initiative, which is appreciated, but occasionally he overcommits, 
          leading to rushed work.

         - Clea Bean (Myself): I have been diligent in completing my tasks and communicating with the team, but I need to 
          work on providing more feedback to others' contributions.

         - Tobi Love: Tobi is very creative and brings fresh perspectives, but sometimes struggles to meet deadlines, 
          which affects our progress.

         - Howie Bowie: Howie is reliable and always follows through, but he could be more engaged during team discussions 
          to provide valuable input.
    
     2. Team Feedback:

         Our team works well together, with strong communication and a willingness to help each other out. However, 
         we need to improve our time management, especially when it comes to balancing individual workloads to prevent 
         last-minute rushes. We could benefit from setting clearer milestones and regularly checking in on our progress 
         to ensure that everyone is aligned and on track.
    
     Let me know if you have any questions.

     Best,  
     Clea Bean

     
     ```

### <a id="head5"></a> Revisions (Checkpoint #1)

- The instructor or grader will assign a grade and provide detailed feedback on your `M4v1.pdf` document. This feedback
  will be sent to all team members via email.
  
- After receiving the feedback, the team must **freeze** the `M4v1.pdf` document in the Milestone 1 folder and apply
  all necessary revisions to a new document named `M4v2.pdf`, which should also be placed in the same folder.


- Whenever a new milestone (V1) is graded, we will also re-grade the `V2` version of the previous milestone to ensure
  all required revisions were properly made. This process is in place to help you base your new milestones (V1) on
  the corrected work in `V2` of the previous milestones, preventing the continuation of any mistakes from earlier versions.

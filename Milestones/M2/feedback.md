# Milestone 2 Docs Revision

## General Feedback

- The documentation is excellent overall. That said, I'm concerned about the team's reliance on Stella. While I believe everyone is trying their best, the work appears to depend too heavily on a single member. This is not sustainable and does not reflect healthy team collaboration.

- For future milestones, all members should take a more active role and work on understanding the technologies involved. The team lead’s role is to review and coordinate, not to carry the project.

- Fatma: your contribution to this milestone was lower than expected. Please in Milestone 3 you will be expected to make up for the lack of contribution in this milestone.

- It’s important that you upskill quickly. We’re entering the part of the semester where technical implementation becomes more critical than documentation.

Keep up the good work!.


## Table of Contents

- Good!

## Data Definitions

- Keep this section high-level for now, without detailed attributes. These will be added in Milestone 3.

## Prioritized Functional Requirements

- Excellent work! one of the best functional requirements I've seen so far. One suggestion: split requirements that cover multiple responsibilities into separate, single-purpose items. For instance, 3.1.1 in P1 could be divided into individual requirements for each role.

## Mockups/Storyboards

- These are solid, but consistency is lacking. It’s clear different members worked on different sections. Maintain a consistent format across the team. No need to revise in M2v2, but apply consistency to the wireframes in M3v1.

## System Design

- Database Architecture:
   - Good ERD overall, but missing some key elements:
     - Many-to-many relationships with associative entities
     - ISA relationships (e.g., for user roles)
     - Aggregation components for grouping entities
   - If you're unsure about these, schedule office hours—I'm happy to walk through them with you.

- Backend Architecture:
   - The relationships used in the UML Class Diagram need revision. Refer to the slides for conventional relationships like association, composition, aggregation, and bidirectional association.
   - Note that while I provide detailed slides on UML Class Diagrams, we do not cover this topic in class. Students are expected to apply prior knowledge from courses like CSC413, which is a prerequisite for this class.

- Network and Deployment:
   - Very well done.

## High Level APIs and Main Algorithms

- This section is excellent.

## List of Contributions

- These scores are consistent and align well with my observations on each team member's contributions. I believe some members are on track to earn higher scores in the next milestone, given their willingness to step in and help when needed.


## Next Steps

1. Freeze `m2v1.pdf` (no further edits allowed). This serves as a time snapshot to evaluate progress.
2. Create a copy named `m2v2` and revise all feedback provided above.
3. Submit `m2v2` to the same directory once revisions are complete.
4. Begin work on `m3v1`.

> Note:  
> `m2v2` is due by the same deadline as `m3v1`, but it should be revised before starting your work on M3. The quality of `m3v1` depends heavily on how well you apply the feedback from `m2v1`.

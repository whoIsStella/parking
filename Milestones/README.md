# Milestones Folder

Welcome to the **Milestones Folder** of our Software Engineering course. 
This folder contains all the technical documentation for the project, organized into five subfolders corresponding to each project milestone.

## Usage

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific milestone and contains all the relevant guidelines associated 
with that phase of the project. This organization ensures that all project artifacts are easily accessible and properly archived for future reference.

Please ensure that all documentation is complete, accurate, and adheres to the guidelines provided for each milestone. 
This documentation serves as a critical part of the project and will be used for grading, portfolio development, and future reference.


## Folder Structure

- **Milestone 1**
  - Brainstorming and list of technologies, technical documentation and throw-away prototype (TAP)

- **Milestone 2**
  - Technical documentation and vertical prototype (VP)

- **Milestone 3**
  - Technical documentation, horizontal prototype (HP), Software Review and Backend Components

- **Milestone 4**
  - Technical documentation, beta prototype (BP), and demo presentation

- **Milestone 5**
  - Final version of your technical documentation and product (ready for production)



## Final Note

The documents in this folder are crucial for demonstrating the progress and outcomes of the project. 
Make sure each milestone's documentation is up to date and reflects the work completed during that phase.

Thank you for your attention to detail and hard work throughout this project!

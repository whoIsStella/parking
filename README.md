## Initial Setup Instructions

### **Team Lead or GitHub Master:**

Please complete the following steps as soon as this repository is created, and no later than the end of the first week of the semester. By Monday of the second week, any student who does not have a team and has not completed all the required steps below will be dropped from the course **No exceptions.**

1. **Repository Naming:**
   - Replace your GitHub username in the repository's name with your team number.
   - For example, if you are in team 9 and your repository's name is `csc648-848-05-sw-engineering-sp25-joseortizcostadev`, then
     replace `joseortizcostadev` with `T09`.
   - The updated repository name should look like this: `csc648-848-05-sw-engineering-sp25-T09`.

2. **Add Team Members:**
   - Once the Team Lead or GitHub Master creates the repository, the instructor will assign admin permissions to
     these roles, and you can then proceed with the next steps:
      - Add **ALL** team members to this repository as collaborators with **WRITE** permissions only.
      - They **MUST** accept the invitation for it to count.
      - Only the team lead and the GitHub master should have **ADMIN** permissions in this repository.

- A role, in this course, indicates the main responsibility each student will handle, but **EVERY STUDENT** must
     contribute to **ALL** aspects of the project and documentation for this course.
- Below is a list of suggested roles that team members can take on. Note that roles can be changed during the
     semester except the `team lead` role.
  - **Team Lead:** Oversees the teamâ€™s progress, coordinates tasks, and ensures that project goals are met on time.
  - **Backend Lead:** Manages the server-side development, ensuring the backend is robust, scalable, and efficient.
  - **Frontend Lead:** Leads the development of the user interface, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
  - **Software Architect:** Designs the overall software structure, making high-level design decisions to align with project requirements.
  - **Database Administrator:** Manages the database systems, ensuring data integrity, performance, and security.
  - **GitHub Master:** Oversees the version control system, manages branches, merges code, and maintains repository integrity.
  - **Technical Writer:** Creates clear and comprehensive documentation for the software, making technical information accessible to users.
  - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates Agile processes, removes impediments, and supports the team in following Scrum practices.
- Students can hold more than one role as long as all members of the team have at least one role assigned.
- Roles must be assigned no later than the second lecture of the semester, except for the team lead role, which must be chosen immediately.
- When ready, fill out the table below. The Team Lead or GitHub Master is responsible for keeping this information
     up to date throughout the semester, as this URL will be used to test all prototypes and the final version of your project.

**Important:** If the URL does not work at the time of testing, the team will receive no credit for the prototype or
project. It is crucial to ensure that the URL is always functional and accessible.

| Team Alias           | Name of the Project         | URL of the Project         | Decision-Making Policy (Consensus or Majority Rule) |

## Repository Structure

- **No code should be stored in the root of your repository.**
- You may rename the `application` folder to match your team's application name, but all source code related to your
  project should be stored inside the `application` folder.
- **Milestone Documents:** All milestone documents must be placed in their corresponding milestone folder.

  - Once version 1 (V1) of a milestone is submitted, the folder for the previous milestone must contain the following:
    1. **Version 1 (V1):** This version will be frozen and cannot be edited anymore after it is submitted.
    2. **Version 2 (V2):** Where all the feedback from the instructor and TA has been revised.
    This version must be completed by the time the next milestone's Version 1 (V1) is submitted.
  
  - For example, if your team is submitting milestone 2 (V1) by its deadline, then your milestone 1 folder must contain
    both milestone 1 (V1) and milestone 1 (V2) with the feedback revisions.
  
  - Each README file for all milestones will include sections on submission guidelines and grading rubrics.
    These rubrics will be used precisely to assess your milestones. They are transparent and available to students,
    ensuring you always know where points may be deducted.
  
- **Credentials Folder:** The `application/credentials/` folder **must not** be renamed, as it will store all
  essential information and tutorials required by the CTO or other authorized personnel to access all components
  of the application. Additional details will be provided when Milestone 1 is assigned.

## ðŸš€ Keep Up the Great Work! ðŸ’ª

Remember, this project is an incredible opportunity to apply your skills, collaborate with your peers, and create
something truly amazing. Not only will you be developing a functional application, but the work you do hereâ€”along
with the documentationâ€”can be a valuable asset to showcase to future employers. Stay focused, communicate openly
with your team, and don't hesitate to reach out for help when needed. Together, you can achieve great things.
Best of luck, and let's make this semester one to remember!
